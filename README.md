# Game of Life

This is my playground for learning new programming languages by implementing a specific exercise which is more than just a hello world program, but rather the game of life by John Conway.

Implementations:

- [Swift](SwiftGameOfLife/)
- [Python](PythonGameOfLife/)
- [JavaScript](JavaScriptGameOfLife/)
