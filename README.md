# Game of Life

This is my playground for playing around with programming languages by implementing a specific exercise which is more than just a hello world program, but rather the 'Game of Life' by John Conway. It is quite easy to implement, but can be done in such a way as to show off many language features for the given programming language.

The list starts off with the programming languages I'm already familiar with, but I'm planning on venturing into more uncharted territory later.

Note: I have a specific pattern I'm testing to see if what I have implemented actually works, but the implementations aren't thoroughly tested, so don't expect perfect implementations.

Implementations:

- [x] [Swift](SwiftGameOfLife/)
- [x] [Python](PythonGameOfLife/)
- [x] [JavaScript](JavaScript/)
- [x] [Kotlin](KotlinGameOfLife/)
- [x] [C](C/)
- [x] [Ruby](RubyGameOfLife/)
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] C++
